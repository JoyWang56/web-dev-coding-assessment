# Task 3 - The world is your oyster!

Duplicate the Gift Card Granny homepage using a framework other than MaterializeCSS (the one we used) http://materializecss.com/. Edit task3.html in this directory as the main markup, but feel free to add any other files necessary.

This is purely a frontend exercise. The page should match colors, respond similarly (or better!), and be efficient.

You do not need to duplicate dynamic functionality or create any other pages. Anything that looks like it came from a database query probably did, but in this task it can be static.

You do not need to be pixel perfect, but it should look good.

You may use the cloudfront image urls from the Gift Card Granny site.
